# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
A Python-based sorting algorithm visualizer that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step using visual animations.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- Python Built-in Sort

## Visualization Design
Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a Python generator that yields
the array state after each significant operation. The Visualizer class
consumes these states and renders them using matplotlib bar charts.

## Features
- Visual comparison of sorting algorithms
- Supports multiple algorithms through a menu-based interface
- Easy to extend with new algorithms

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
